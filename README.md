# ECIES
## About
#### ECIES for encryption and decryption along with a text summariser for plain text, files and urls. 
Documents which would have taken large amounts of time to read are summarised to include keywords / details to convey the original message in a shorter, more readable form. This saves time spent reading unnecessary details and memory as well.
<br/><br/>
This document is then encrypted using highly secure ECC algorithm to ensure that the CIA triad principles are upheld, i.e. The contents of the document are confidential, cannot be tampered with and is available only to authorized users when they need it.

## Tools Used
- Randomizer to generate polynomial values for ECC
- pandas for Data Manipulation
- pickleshare for the Data Structures 
- numpy for Array Data Calculations
- tkinter for the User Interface
- SpaCy for Natural Language Processing
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
